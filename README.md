## Website Design Choices 

### Colours

For the PS5 GameWave platform, the choice of colors plays a crucial role in creating an engaging and visually appealing user experience. The primary colors selected include PlayStation Blue (#003087), White (#FFFFFF), and Black (#000000). PlayStation Blue, a shade synonymous with the PlayStation brand, is prominently used for headers, buttons, and important highlights, reinforcing brand identity and consistency. The clean and minimalist white serves as the background color, providing a neutral canvas that allows content and images to stand out, while black is utilized for text, creating a high contrast with white to enhance readability and ensure that the content is easily legible.

Complementing these primary colors are secondary shades like silver (#C0C0C0), light blue (#007ACC), and red (#FF0000). Silver is used for subtle accents, borders, or secondary buttons, adding a modern and tech-inspired feel to the platform. Light Blue, a vibrant and energetic colour, is ideal for hover effects, links, and highlights, providing a lively and interactive experience for users. Red, a bold and attention-grabbing color, is strategically used for calls to action such as "Buy Now" buttons or sale notifications, ensuring that key actions and promotions stand out.

In addition to these, Gold (#FFD700) is chosen as an accent color for special promotions or premium products. This luxurious hue adds a sense of exclusivity and value, enhancing the perceived quality of premium offerings on the platform. Together, these colors create a cohesive and attractive visual identity for PS5 GameWave, enhancing user engagement and overall site aesthetics.

### Fonts

I conducted extensive experimentation with a diverse range of fonts available on the Google Fonts website. This exploration aimed to identify a typeface that is highly fitting for the PS5 GameWave platform, dedicated to PS5 games, accessories, and merchandise. After thorough assessment and testing, I selected typefaces that perfectly embody the platform's essence and objectives.

Utilizing Open Sans as the primary body text font for the PS5 GameWave platform is supported by its exceptional readability, versatile design, and widespread compatibility. Open Sans offers a balanced and contemporary typographic style that ensures users can comfortably engage with content, promoting comprehension and reducing visual fatigue. Its diverse range of font weights allows for effective typographic hierarchy, creating structured and visually appealing layouts. As a web-safe font with extensive cross-browser and cross-device support, Open Sans guarantees consistent and reliable text rendering, providing a seamless and accessible experience to a broad audience. Furthermore, its neutrality and adaptability make it a trusted choice for conveying professional and engaging content, contributing to a positive and user-friendly platform environment.

I have chosen to use the Lato typeface exclusively for headings on the PS5 GameWave platform. Lato's distinctive design and readability make it an ideal choice for capturing users' attention and establishing a clear typographic hierarchy. Its versatile range of font weights and styles allows for flexibility in presenting content while maintaining a cohesive and professional visual identity. This selection aligns seamlessly with the platform's goal of offering a polished and engaging user experience. Lato’s modern and clean aesthetic complements the overall design, ensuring that important information is highlighted effectively and is easy for users to navigate.


### Icons

For the PS5 GameWave platform, I will incorporate icons sourced from the Flat Icon website (https://www.flaticon.com/). The use of these icons will significantly enhance both the visual appeal and usability of the platform. Icons play a crucial role in guiding users through the website by providing clear and intuitive visual cues. This aids in quickly identifying various sections and features, such as the shopping cart, wishlist, product categories, and user accounts. Additionally, these icons contribute to a cohesive and engaging design, reinforcing the platform's branding and user experience. By carefully selecting and positioning these icons, I aim to create a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience, making it easier for users to navigate the extensive range of PS5 games, accessories, and merchandise available on PS5 GameWave.
